# StarTrekDatabase
Project Completed on CSE 572 Database Systems Class.

The Star Trek Database project was created to satisfy the needs and wants of the company Star Trek.
The Database was designed to meet the companie's expectations. The overall implementation of the 
Database is easy to follow and really straight forward, because when creating a project is great 
to have correct and satisfying results, however it is as important for each component of the 
project to be easy to understand and easy to follow.
